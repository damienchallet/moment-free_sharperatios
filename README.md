# moment-free_sharperatios
This repository contains the code for my work entitled "Moment-free Sharpe ratio estimation with total drawdown durations". All you need to reproduce my results is here.

In particular: 

run_efficiency.R is used to reproduce the figures that compare the efficiency of my new estimator

run_splines.R pre-computes the relationship between R0bar (see paper) and the true Sharpe ratio
 
timeseriesSNR.R loads these relationships and apply them to a timeseries.
